Add bold Yellow text for the product name ("TravelPro Trolley Bags") and tagline ("Journey in Style, Built to Last") in Arial. Include a Yellow CTA button.
Slide 2: White background with a trolley bag image (Pixabay: https://images.pixabay.com/photos/2451039). Use a Font Awesome shield icon (fa-shield-alt) in Yellow, Deep Blue heading ("Unbreakable Durability"), and White text on a light overlay.
Slide 3: White background with a lock image (Pixabay: https://images.pixabay.com/photos/3456789). Use a Font Awesome lock icon (fa-lock) in Yellow, Deep Blue heading ("Secure TSA Locks"), and White text.

Typography and Layout:
Use Arial for readability, with bold weights for headings (36-48px) and regular for body text (20-24px).
